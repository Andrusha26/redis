# redis

It's a simple, light-weight and basic implementation of distributed cache like Redis.
Currently it allows only deploy-time partitioning, so functionality is poor.

You can run by docker-compose or manually using .net core CLI. Both master and child allow swagger endpoing

TODO:

add error handling

add rebalancing of the partitions

add integration and  load test

add remove method
